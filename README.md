Project title: Wealth and Winning in the MLB

Team: Raphael Lafeldt, Edmund Eliason, Judah Prisk, Neil Gopalan

This project explores the relationship between team payroll spending and on-field performance in Major League Baseball (MLB) compared to the National Football League (NFL), a salary-capped league.
Our primary research question is:

To what extent does payroll spending influence team performance in Major League Baseball compared to salary-capped leagues such as the NFL?

Because MLB does not have a hard salary cap, large differences in payroll may translate into competitive advantages. In contrast, the NFL’s strict salary cap is designed to promote parity. This project compares these leagues using statistical analysis to determine how strongly spending correlates with winning outcomes.
The analysis includes:
  Data cleaning and transformation
  Exploratory data visualizations
  Regression analysis measuring the effect of payroll on win percentage
  Cross-league comparison of spending–performance elasticities
  Interpretation of parity implications for sports economics
